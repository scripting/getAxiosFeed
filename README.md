# getAxiosFeed

Some feeds block access from Digital Ocean, so this app downloads the feeds from my LAN and uploads to a place that isn't blocked so we can use the feeds in our RSS reader app.

We're using it for more than Axios, but that's where we started, with their main news feed, and added others as they appeared.
